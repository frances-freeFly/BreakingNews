		<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
		<h2>Our Philosophy</h2>
		<p>
		Compunnel, Inc. believes electronic privacy is crucial to the ongoing success of the Internet, whether as a commercial or an entertainment medium. Our policy is to keep the personal information we receive completely confidential and use it solely for internal purposes. We will not share your personal information with any other party.<br/>
		Please revisit our Privacy Policy from time to time to be sure that you are familiar with our current policy. Your continued use of our website after any modifications to this Privacy Policy will be viewed as representing your acceptance of such changes.<br/>
		We will not disclose any individually identifiable information about our clients to any third party.
		</p>

		<h2>Information Collected</h2>
		<p>When you register with or contact us, we may require you to give us your name, contact information, business information, email address, website details, and details on your specific project requirements (“Inquiry Data”).</p>

		<h2>Use of Personal Information</h2>
		<p>Compunnel Inc.’s primary goal in collecting personal information is to deliver a customized and personalized service to our clients. Compunnel Inc. also uses the personal information it collects to send clients email notifications of new features or services available, and other information that Compunnel Inc. feels might be of interest to its clients. To provide our clients with more personalized, relevant, and intelligent service, Compunnel Inc. regularly makes improvements to the Compunnel Inc. website. The collection of personal data greatly assists us in this improvement process by identifying the specific interests and needs of the many clients of Compunnel Inc.<br/>
		Because we collect information on our website for various reasons, we have outlined what information we collect and what we do with it in the following sections:</p>

		<h2>Registration and/or Request Forms</h2>
		<p>Our site contains registration and/or request forms that require users to give us contact information (such as their name and email address). We use customer contact information from the registration and request forms to send you information about our services and to contact you when necessary.</p>

		<h2>Sharing Information</h2>
		<p>Except as set forth in the Terms of Use, we will not disclose personal data about you to any third party without first receiving your permission. No personally identifiable data or information will be shared with advertisers or any third parties. Some of your information may be shared on an aggregate basis only, as a part of a larger set of statistics (for example, statistics that indicate the percentage of our clients/users in a specific industry), but that information will not be sufficient to permit the recipient to identify you.</p>

		<h2>Business Transfers</h2>
		<p>If there is a change in control of Compunnel Inc., (whether by merger, sale, or otherwise), the personal contact information we collect could be sold as part of that transaction and potentially could be used by the purchaser. Should a merger, sale, or related business transaction ever take place between Compunnel Inc. and another company, a notice will be posted on the Compunnel Inc. website so that you may be made aware of any personal impact.</p>

		<h2>Cookies</h2>
		<p>Compunnel Inc. makes use of a technology called cookies. Cookies are small pieces of information that are stored by your web browser software on your computer’s hard drive or temporarily in your computer’s memory. The use of cookies is now an industry standard, and users will find them on most major websites. Cookies, by themselves, cannot be used to find out the identity of any user. Compunnel Inc. will only store information that adds to your browsing experience. This information is not personally identifiable. If for some reason you would rather not take advantage of the benefits made possible with cookies, most Web browsers allow you to reject cookies or to choose which cookies to accept. Check your browser’s documentation and help files, or contact your browser vendor, for more information about its cookie features.</p>

		<h2>IP Addresses</h2>
		<p>We use your computer’s IP (Internet Protocol) address to help diagnose problems with our server and to administer our website. Your IP address is used to help identify you and your time spent at our sites, and to gather broad demographic information. This allows us to see which parts of our sites users are visiting. We do not link IP addresses to anything personally identifiable. This means, for instance, that a user’s session will be tracked, but the user will remain anonymous.</p>

		<h2>Other Sites</h2>
		<p>This website contains links to other sites outside the Compunnel Inc. domains. Compunnel Inc. is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such websites.</p>

		<h2>Public Forums</h2>
		<p>Some areas of our site, such as the blog, are open to our clients and the public. Please remember that any information that you disclose in these areas becomes public information; you should exercise caution when deciding whether or not to disclose your personal information.</p>

		<h2>Security</h2>
		<p>This site has security measures in place to protect against the loss, misuse, and alteration of the information under our control. When a user submits personal information, it is stored in secure operating environments that are not available to the public. This prevents any malicious use of your information. All financial information that is submitted to our site is encrypted and stored on our payment gateway’s private servers, which are not accessible to the public.</p>

		<h2>Service Quality Monitoring</h2>
		<p>Many of our interactions may involve you calling us or our calling you. Please be aware that it is Compunnel Inc.’s general practice to monitor and in some cases record such calls for quality assurance purposes.</p>

		<h2>Disclosures Required By Law</h2>
		<p>In certain circumstances, it is possible that personal information may be subject to disclosure pursuant to judicial or other government orders and/or warrants.</p>
